# The MakeCode Editor

The [MakeCode Editor for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) is a block based programming environment developed by Microsoft.

```{note}
There are two versions of the MakeCode editor. One is specifically used for micro:bit: https://makecode.microbit.org/

There is also a version of the MakeCode editor that is used to create arcade games. This version does not have the blocks to controle the micro:bit unless it is a micro:bit arcade device.
