# Introduction

In this lesson you will explore using the micro:bit with light-emitting diodes (LEDs). You will learn how to use its GPIO pins to connect LEDs and resistors and understand how they interact within a circuit. You will learn about Ohm's Law, which helps predict how electricity flows, and see it as we create complete and incomplete circuits. Finally, you will use MakeCode to make your LEDs blink in patterns. By the end of this lesson, you will grasp basic electronic principles and gain hands-on experience in programming and circuit design.
