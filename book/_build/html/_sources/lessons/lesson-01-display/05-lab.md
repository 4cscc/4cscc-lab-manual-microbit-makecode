# Lab: Creating a Digital Nametag

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to program a BBC micro:bit to display your name and an animation, effectively creating a digital nametag.

## Materials

- 1 PC or Laptop
- 1 BBC micro:bit
- 1 Micro USB cable

## Instructions

1. **Setup**: Connect your BBC micro:bit to your PC or laptop using the Micro USB cable.
2. **Programming Environment**: Open the [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) programming environment on your PC or laptop.
3. **Display Your Name**:
   - Write a program to display your name on the BBC micro:bit’s LED display. Your name should scroll across the display from right to left.
   - Test your program by uploading it to the BBC micro:bit. Make sure your name scrolls correctly across the display.
4. **Display an Image**:
   - Modify your program to display an image of your choice on the LED display after your name has scrolled across the micro: bit display. You can use a predefined image or create your own.
   - Test your program again to make sure the image displays correctly.
5. **Create an Animation**: Create an animation with a minimum of two images.
6. **Test Your Nametag**: After you’ve written your code, download it to your micro:bit and test your device. Make sure the name and animation is displayed as expected.
7. **Troubleshooting**:  If your program doesn’t work as expected, use your problem-solving skills to identify any issues in your code and fix them.
8. **Present Your Work**: Prepare a short presentation to share your nametag with the class. 
9. **Reflection**:  Write a short paragraph explaining the logic behind your code and how it results in the display of your name and image on the micro:bit.
