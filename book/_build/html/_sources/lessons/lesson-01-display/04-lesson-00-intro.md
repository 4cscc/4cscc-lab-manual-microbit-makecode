# Lesson 1: The micro:bit Display

## What is the 5×5 LED matrix display?

The 5×5 LED matrix display is a grid of 25 tiny red LED lights arranged in 5 rows and 5 columns. Each LED can be turned on or off individually, allowing you to create different patterns, images, and even simple animations. You can use the display to show text, numbers, or fun pixel art by programming which LEDs light up and when. It’s like having a tiny screen on your micro:bit that you can control with your code, making it a great way to learn about programming and create interactive projects.
