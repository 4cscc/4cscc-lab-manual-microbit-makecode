# Opener

## Pixel Art

Take a 5×5 grid sheet from your teacher. This grid has 25 small squares arranged in a 5×5 pattern. 

A downloadable file with 5×5grids is available here.

### Create Your Pixel Art: 

- You have 5 minutes to create pixel art using the grid. Each square represents one “pixel” of your art, so think about how to fill in the squares to create a picture or design. 
- Be Creative. Your pixel art can be anything you like – a simple picture, a pattern, or even your initials. Have fun and be creative with your design.

### Prepare to Share: 

- After 5 minutes, be ready to hold up your grid and share your pixel art with the class.
