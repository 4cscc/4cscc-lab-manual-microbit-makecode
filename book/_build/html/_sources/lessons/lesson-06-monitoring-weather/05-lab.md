# Lab: Displaying Weather Station Data

## Objective

In this lab, you will incorporate all the previous lessons to build a weather station that displays temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and the wind direction reading.

## Materials

- 1 PC or Laptop
- 1 BBC micro:bit
- 1 SparkFun micro:climate Kit
- 1 ELECFREAKS OLED display

## Instructions

1. **Setup**: Connect your BBC micro:bit to your PC or laptop using the Micro USB cable. Place it into the SparkFun weather:bit. Connect the ELECFREAKS OLED display to the weather:bit.
2. **Programming Environment**: Open the [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) programming environment on your PC or laptop.
3. **Code Your Device**: Using the SparkFun weather:bit and the micro:bit create a program that:

- Measures the temperature
- Measures the humidity
- Measures the atmospheric pressure
- Measures the wind speed
- Measures the wind direcrion

4. **Test Your Device**: After youâ€™ve written your code, download it to your micro:bit and test your code of the weather station. Write a brief report explaining your design process, how you coded your device, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.
5. **Document Your Work**: Take pictures of the weather station and the OLED screen with the measurements displayed.
6. **Present Your Work**: Prepare a short presentation to share your weather station with the class
7. **Reflection**: Write a brief report explaining the logic behind your code and how it results in an atmospheric sensing device.
