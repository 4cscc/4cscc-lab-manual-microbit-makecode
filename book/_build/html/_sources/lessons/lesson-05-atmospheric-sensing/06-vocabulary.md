# Vocabulary

**air quality index (AQI)**: a number that tells you how clean or polluted the air is. It helps people understand if the air is safe to breathe or if it might be harmful, especially for people with health problems. The higher the number, the more polluted the air is.

**equivalent carbon dioxide (eCO2)**: a way to measure the effect of different greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, by comparing them to carbon dioxide. It helps scientists understand how much all these gases combined contribute to global warming, using carbon dioxide as a standard unit.

**kilopascal (kPa)**:  unit used to measure pressure. One kilopascal equals 1,000 pascals, and it tells us how much force is being applied over an area. For example, it can be used to measure the pressure in tires or the air pressure in the atmosphere.

**pascal**: a unit used to measure pressure. It tells us how much force is applied to an area. One pascal equals a tiny amount of pressure, like the weight of a small feather spread over a large surface. Itâ€™s often used to measure things like air pressure or the pressure inside a container.

**whitespace**: blank spaces, tabs, and new lines in your code.
