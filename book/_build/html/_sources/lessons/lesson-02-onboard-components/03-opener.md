# Opener

## Exploring the BBC micro:bit

### Materials

> - 1 BBC micro:bit per student

### Explore the Components

With your partner, explore the following onboard components of the micro:bit:

- **Buttons A and B:** How could you use buttons in a project?
- **LED Display:** What could you show or display with the LEDs?
- **Movement Sensor (Accelerometer):** How might detecting movement be useful in a project?
- **Temperature Sensor:** What kind of project could measure temperature?
- **Microphone:** How could sound detection be used creatively?

### Brainstorm Your Own Project

- Imagine you could build something using the micro:bit’s onboard components.

- Think about how each part of the micro:bit could be used in your project.
- With your partner, develop an idea for a project that uses at least two or more components. For example, could you make a simple game, a weather station, or a musical instrument?

### Prepare to Share

- After brainstorming, prepare a short explanation of your project idea. Be ready to explain which components you would use and how they would work together to bring your idea to life.

### Present Your Ideas

- Each pair will take turns presenting their imagined projects to the class, explaining how they would use the micro:bit’s onboard components to build their idea.
