# Using the Speaker

This section will focus on the speaker or buzzer on the micro:bit to play a built-in melody. The speaker is more like a primitive speaker (a piezoelectric buzzer) on an old PC. It will not play the range of sounds a regular speaker will play. But it is works for most projects.

Select the "Music" drawer in the Toolbox.

This drawer has many blocks that can be used to code the speaker. You can play specific tones, create melodies and change the volume. We will focus on playing a built-in melody.

Scroll down and find the `play <melody dadadum> block`. Make sure to scroll down and select this block. The other `play` block closer to the top is used for custom melodies.

Place the `play` block in the `forever` block.

The code is now ready to be flashed on the micro:bit.
