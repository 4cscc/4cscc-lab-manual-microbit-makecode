# Vocabulary

**anode**: the positive terminal on an electronic component like a battery or an LED, where electricity flows in.

**breadboard**: a tool used in building and testing electronic circuits by easily inserting components into its holes without needing to solder.

**cathode**: the negative terminal on an electronic component like a battery or an LED, where electricity flows out.

**circuit**: a path that electricity flows through. It usually includes a power source, like a battery, wires, and other components like lights or motors. For electricity to flow and make things work, the circuit must be complete, meaning all parts are connected.

**complete circuit**: a closed loop that allows electricity to flow all the way around from a power source, through various components, and back to the power source.

**electric current**: the flow of electrical charge through a circuit, similar to how water flows through a pipe.

**incomplete circuit**: a broken loop where electricity cannot flow all the way around because there is a gap or break somewhere in the path. 

**input**: the data or signals it receives from sensors or buttons, which it then uses to perform actions.

**light-emitting diode (LED)**: a small, energy-efficient light that lights up when electricity flows through it in the right direction.

**negative terminal**: is the point on a battery or power source where the electric current flows out, usually marked with a minus sign (-).

**output**: the response or action it produces, like lighting up an LED or sending a signal to a motor, after processing the input.

**pinout**: a diagram or description that shows what each pin or connection point on a microcontroller or electronic device does, helping you know where to connect different components.

**positive terminal**: the point on a battery or power source where the electric current starts, and itâ€™s usually marked with a plus sign (+).

**resistance**: what slows down the flow of electricity in a circuit, similar to how friction slows down objects moving across a surface.

**resistor**: an electronic component that slows down the flow of electricity in a circuit, helping to control the amount of power that reaches other parts.

**voltage**: the force that pushes electric current through a circuit, much like water pressure pushes water through a hose.
