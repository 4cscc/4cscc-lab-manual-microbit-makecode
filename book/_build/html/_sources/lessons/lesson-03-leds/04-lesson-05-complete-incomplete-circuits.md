# Complete and Incomplete Circuits

## Complete Circuit

A **complete circuit** is like a full loop or pathway that allows electricity to flow from a power source through various lights, motors, or components (like and back to the power source). Imagine it as a circle where the electricity can travel around and around without any breaks. For example, if you connect a power source to a LED with wires in a complete loop, the LED will light up. 

Here are some examples of complete circuits:

## Incomplete Circuit

On the other hand, an **incomplete circuit** has a break or gap in the loop, so the electricity can’t flow all the way around. This is like a broken circle where the path is interrupted, so if there’s a gap in the wires or a switch is turned off, the LED won’t light up because the circuit is incomplete.

Can you identify the problem with each of these circuits? Prepare for a brief class discussion where you will explain what the problem is with each circuit and how it can be fixed.

There are many ways to connect LEDs to the micro:bit. As long as the circuit is complete the code should make the LED illuminate.
