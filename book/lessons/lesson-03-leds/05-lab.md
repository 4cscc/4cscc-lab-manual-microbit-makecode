# Lab: Simulating a Stoplight

## Objective

In this lab, you will simulate a stoplight using the BBC micro:bit.

## Materials

- 1 PC or Laptop
- 1 BBC micro:bit
- 1 Micro USB cable
- 1 green LED
- 1 yellow LED
- 1 red LED
- 3 47Ω resistors (yellow, violet, black, golden)
- 4 male-to-female jumper wires (can match the colors of the LEDs, and GND)
- 1 Kitronik prototyping plate (micro:bit breakout board and breadboard)

## Instructions

1. **Setup**: Connect your BBC micro:bit to your PC or laptop using the Micro USB cable. Place it into the Kitronik prototyping breakout board.
2. **Programming Environment**: Open the [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) programming environment on your PC or laptop.
3. **Build Your Circuit:**
   - Place the red, yellow, and green LEDs in the breadboard.
   - Add the resistors to the proper leads. (Remember that the shorter lead is attached to `GND` or `0V`).
   - Attach the resistors.
   - Connect the components to the Kitronik prototyping breakout board.
4. **Code Your device:** Using the MakeCode editor, write code to control your device.
   - Think of a stoplight:
     - What is the sequence of the different lights?
     - What are possible durations for the lights?
     - Can you use a button to trigger the stoplight? **(Not required)**
   - Write code to reflect the values.
5. **Test Your Device:** After you’ve written your code, download it to your micro:bit and test your device. Make sure all lights behave like a stoplight.
6. **Document Your Work:** Take pictures or videos of your simulated stoplight in action. Write a brief report explaining your design process, how you coded your device, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.
7. **Present Your Work:** Prepare a short presentation to share your stoplight with the class.
8. **Reflection**: Write a brief report explaining the logic behind your code and how it results in a simulated stoplight.
