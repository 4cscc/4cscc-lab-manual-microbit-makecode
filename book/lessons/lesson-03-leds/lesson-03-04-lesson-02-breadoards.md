# Breadboards

## What is a breadboard?

A **breadboard** is a tool that helps you build and test electronic circuits without needing to solder, which means no permanent connections are made. It has many tiny holes arranged in rows and columns where you can insert electronic components like resistors, LEDs, and wires. These holes are connected in a special way inside the breadboard, allowing electricity to flow between the parts you connect. Using a breadboard makes it easy to experiment and change your circuit if something isn’t working right. It’s like a playground for electronics where you can safely and easily create and test your ideas.

A breadboard commonly has terminal strips with five interconnected holes. The five terminal strips on one side of the breadboard don't connect to the terminal strips on the opposite side. The terminal strips are the breadboard's main prototyping area. 

Breadboards also have power rails that run the length of the breadboard that are labeled `+` and `-`. These holes are used for a power source or voltage in `+` and ground `-`. 

The terminal strips are labeled in the image below.

The rails and terminal strips can be seen below. Notice how there is a center divider that separates the power strips.
