# Introduction

This lesson explores using the micro:bit and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). We'll explore how to use its GPIO pins to connect components like LEDs and resistors and understand how they interact within a circuit. You'll learn about Ohm's Law, which helps predict how electricity flows, and see it in action as we create both complete and incomplete circuits. Finally, we'll use MakeCode to make your LEDs blink in patterns. By the end of this lesson, you'll not only grasp basic electronic principles but also gain hands-on experience in programming and circuit design.
