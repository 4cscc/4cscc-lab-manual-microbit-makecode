# Vocabulary

**anode**: the positive terminal on an electronic component like a battery or an LED, where electricity flows in.

**breadboard**: a tool used in building and testing electronic circuits by easily inserting components into its holes without needing to solder.

**cathode**: the negative terminal on an electronic component like a battery or an LED, where electricity flows out.

**complete circuit**: a closed loop that allows electricity to flow all the way around from a power source, through various components, and back to the power source.

**electric current**: the flow of electrical charge through a circuit, similar to how water flows through a pipe.

**incomplete circuit**: a broken loop where electricity cannot flow all the way around because there is a gap or break somewhere in the path. 

**light-emitting diode (LED)**: a small, energy-efficient light that lights up when electricity flows through it in the right direction.

**negative terminal**: 

**positive terminal**: 

**resistance**: what slows down the flow of electricity in a circuit, similar to how friction slows down objects moving across a surface.

**resistor**: an electronic component that slows down the flow of electricity in a circuit, helping to control the amount of power that reaches other parts.

**voltage**: the force that pushes electric current through a circuit, much like water pressure pushes water through a hose.
