# First Look at General-Purpose Input/Output GPIO Pins

The micro:bit has 19 assignable **general-purpose input/output (GPIO)** pins. These pins can be used as inputs for different switches and sensors. They can also control outputs like light-emitting diodes (LEDs), displays, buzzers, and motors. Some pins are designed to work with alligator clip leads, but others require breakout boards to access the pins. The pinout for the micro:bit is displayed below:

Notice how many pins have many functions. GPIO pins 3, 4, 6, 7, and 10 are shared with the LED matrix display. Buttons A and B are also connected to GPIO pins 5 and 11. In this lesson, we will learn to connect the GPIO pins to a breadboard using the Kitronik prototyping plate breakout board.
