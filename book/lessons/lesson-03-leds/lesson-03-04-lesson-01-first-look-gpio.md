# First Look at General-Purpose Input/Output GPIO Pins

The micro:bit has 19 assignable **general-purpose input/output (GPIO)** pins. These pins can be used as inputs for different switches and sensors. They can also control outputs like light-emitting diodes (LEDs), displays, buzzers, and motors. Some pins are designed to work with alligator clip leads, but others require breakout boards to access the pins.
