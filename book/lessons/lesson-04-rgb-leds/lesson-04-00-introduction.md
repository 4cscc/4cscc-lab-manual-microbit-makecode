# Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to use a common cathode RGB LED with the micro:bit to create many different colors. A common cathode RGB LED has three colors—red, green, and blue—that share a common negative connection, allowing us to mix these colors to make almost any color you can imagine. We’ll explore how to connect the RGB LED to the micro:bit and use code to control the brightness of each color. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to program your micro:bit to light up the RGB LED in various colors.
