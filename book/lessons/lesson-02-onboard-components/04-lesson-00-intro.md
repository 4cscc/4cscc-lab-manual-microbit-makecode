# Lesson 2: Onboard Components

## What are the microbits onboard components?

**Onboard components** are the built-in parts of a device, like the BBC micro:bit, that let it do different things without needing extra attachments. These components include sensors that detect movement, temperature, direction, buttons, a microphone, and a speaker. Because these parts are already built into the micro:bit, you can use them immediately without attaching the micro:bit to external components.
