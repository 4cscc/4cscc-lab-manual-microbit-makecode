# Introduction

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use the 5x5 LED matrix display on the BBC micro:bit to show text and images. The LED matrix is a grid of 25 tiny lights that can light up in different patterns to create words and pictures. We’ll start by learning about strings, which are sequences of characters, and how to display them using MakeCode. Next, you’ll explore using MakeCode blocks to show built-in images, create custom images, and make simple animations. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to make your micro:bit display messages, pictures, and animations.
