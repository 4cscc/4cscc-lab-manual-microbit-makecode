# Variables

## What is a variable?

In computer science, a **variable** is like a container that holds information. This information can be a number, a word, or something else. For example, if you’re writing a game, you might have a variable to keep track of the player’s score. Every time the player scores a point, the computer changes the number in that variable. Variables help computers remember things while running a program, making it possible to do all kinds of tasks, like simple math, keeping track of a game’s progress, or storing sensor data.
