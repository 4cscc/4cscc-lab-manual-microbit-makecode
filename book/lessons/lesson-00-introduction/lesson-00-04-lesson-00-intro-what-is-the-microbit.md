# What is the BBC micro:bit

The BBC micro:bit is a **microcontroller** designed to help students learn about programming and technology. It has buttons, sensors, and lights built into a tiny board that you can hold in your hand. You can write simple programs with a computer and send them to the micro:bit, making it do things like display messages, play sounds, illuminate lights, or sense the environment. It's used in schools to teach coding and electronics in a fun and interactive way, helping students learn how to code and create their own inventions.

The micro:bit has:

- A 5Ã—5 LED matrix display (with light sensing capabilities)
- Two programmable buttons
- A temperature sensor
- An accelerometer and gyroscope
- A capable of sensing touch
- A buzzer
- A microphone
- 19 general-purpose input/output pins to connect external inputs, outputs, sensors, actuators, and other electronic components. 

The micro:bit is programmable using MakeCode (a block-based language from Microsoft) and MicroPython (a subset of the Python programming language). MakeCode will be used in every lesson.
