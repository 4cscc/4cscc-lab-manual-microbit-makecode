# Measuring Equivalent Carbon Dioxide (ECO2) Levels

## What is eCO2?

eCO2, short for Equivalent Carbon Dioxide, is a measure of how much carbon dioxide (CO2) is in the air. It tells us about the quality of the air we breathe. High levels of CO2 can indicate that there's not enough fresh air circulating, which can affect how well we can think and feel. eCO2 sensors are used in buildings and classrooms to help keep the air clean and healthy for everyone inside.
