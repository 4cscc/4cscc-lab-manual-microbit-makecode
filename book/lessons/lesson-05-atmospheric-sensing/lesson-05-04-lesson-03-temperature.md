# Measuring the Temperature

## What is Celcius?

Celsius is a way to measure temperature. It's named after a scientist named Anders Celsius. In Celsius, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees. So, if it's 20 degrees Celsius outside, it's not too cold or too hotâ€”it's just right for a lot of people. Scientists use Celsius because it's easy to understand and it's based on how water behaves at different temperatures.
