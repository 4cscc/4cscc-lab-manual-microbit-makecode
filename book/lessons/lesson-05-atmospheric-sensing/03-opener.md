## Understanding Air Quality

### Materials

> - Sticky notes or small pieces of paper
> - Pen or pencil

### Activity Steps

#### Think About It
- What does the term “air quality” mean to you? What do you think about, envision, or imagine when you hear those words?

#### Write It Down
- On your sticky note or piece of paper, write down one place where you think the air quality might be really good and one place where you think it might be bad. Think about different places you know, like a busy city or a park. How might air quality affect your body, community, and overall well-being?

#### Pair Up and Share
- Find a classmate and share what you wrote. Listen to their ideas too. You have about 2 minutes for this.

#### Class Discussion
- Be ready to share one idea from your discussion with the class. We will talk about why some places might have better or worse air quality and what factors could affect it.
