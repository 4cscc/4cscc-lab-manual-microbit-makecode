# Lab: Displaying Atmospheric Sensor Data

## Objective

In this lab, you will incorporate all the previous lessons to build an atmospheric sensing device that displays the temperature, humidity, atmopheric pressure, the Air Quaility Index (AQI), and eCO2 levels.

## Materials

- 1 PC or Laptop
- 1 BBC micro:bit
- 1 Kitronik Air Quality and Environmental Board

## Instructions

1. **Setup**: Connect your BBC micro:bit to your PC or laptop using the Micro USB cable. Place it into the Kitronik Air Quality and Environmental Board.
2. **Programming Environment**: Open the [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) programming environment on your PC or laptop.
3. **Code Your Device**: Using the Kitronik Air Quality and Environmental Board and the micro:bit create a program that:

- Measures the temperature
- Measures the humidity
- Measures the atmospheric pressure
- Measures the Air Quality Index
- Measures the eCO2 level
- Displays the readings above on the OLED screen

4. **Test Your Device**: After youâ€™ve written your code, download it to your micro:bit and test your code of your atmospheric sensing device. Write a brief report explaining your design process, how you coded your device, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.
5. **Document Your Work**: Take picture of your air quality sensing device. 
6. **Present Your Work**: Prepare a short presentation to share your air quality sensing device with the class.
7. **Reflection**: Write a brief report explaining the logic behind your code and how it results in an atmospheric sensing device.
