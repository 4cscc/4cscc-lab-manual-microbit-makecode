# Introduction
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use a micro:bit to measure and understand air quality around you. We’ll explore how to use sensors connected to the micro:bit to measure temperature, humidity, air pressure, Air Quality Index (AQI), and carbon dioxide levels (eCO2). These measurements help us know how clean or polluted the air is and what conditions we’re living in. By the end of the lesson, you’ll be able to collect and interpret data on air quality, helping you understand the environment better and think about ways to improve it.

This lesson will use the Kitronik Air Quality and Environmental Board for micro:bit displayed below:
