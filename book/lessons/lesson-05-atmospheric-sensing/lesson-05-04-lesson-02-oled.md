# Using the OLED Display

## What is an OLED Display?

An OLED display is a type of screen used in many devices like phones and TVs. What makes OLED special is that each pixel on the screen can emit its own light, unlike older screens where a separate backlight is needed. This makes OLED displays very bright and colorful, with deep blacks and vibrant colors. They also use less power, which helps devices last longer between charges. Overall, OLED displays give us clearer and more colorful images on our devices.
