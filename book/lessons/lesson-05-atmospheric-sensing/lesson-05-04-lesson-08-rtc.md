# Using The Real-Time Clock

## What is a Real-Time Clock

A real-time clock, or RTC, is a special device that keeps track of the current time and date, even when the main power to a device is turned off. It works like a tiny, super-accurate watch inside your electronics. This is useful for things like setting alarms, keeping accurate logs of events, or any project where you need to know the exact time. An RTC is often used in computers, phones, and microcontroller projects to make sure they always know what time it is, no matter what happens.
