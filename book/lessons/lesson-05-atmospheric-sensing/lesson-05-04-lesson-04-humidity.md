# Measuring Humidity

## What is Humidity?

Humidity is a measure of how much moisture or water vapor is in the air around us. It's what makes the air feel sticky or dry. When humidity is high, like on a humid day, it means there's a lot of moisture in the air. When humidity is low, the air feels drier. Humidity is important for weather and how comfortable we feel. It can affect things like how quickly sweat evaporates from our skin, which helps cool us down.
