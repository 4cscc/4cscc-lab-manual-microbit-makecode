# Introduction

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use a micro:bit and a weather station to measure various weather conditions and environmental factors. We’ll use sensors connected to the micro:bit to measure temperature, humidity, air pressure, soil moisture, soil temperature, wind direction, wind speed, and rainfall. These measurements will help us understand and track weather patterns and environmental conditions. By the end of the lesson, you’ll be able to gather and analyze weather data, giving you a better understanding of how different factors interact to create the weather we experience every day.

This lesson will use the SparkFun micro:climate kit for micro:bit displayed below:
