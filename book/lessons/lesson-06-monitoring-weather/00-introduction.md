# Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to use a micro:bit and a weather station to measure various weather conditions and environmental factors. You will use sensors connected to the micro:bit to measure temperature, humidity, air pressure, soil moisture, soil temperature, wind direction, wind speed, and rainfall. These measurements will help us understand and track weather patterns and environmental conditions. By the end of the lesson, you will be able to gather and analyze weather data, giving you a better understanding of how different factors interact to create the weather we experience every day.

This lesson will use the SparkFun micro:climate kit for micro:bit to collect data:
